## Project Overview
In the module 7 - Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis, we learned about data modeling, engineering, and analysis. With our newly acquired knowledge of DataFrames and tabular data, we created entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), import data into a database, troubleshot common errors, and created queries that use data to answer questions using various SQL techniques.

## Objectives 
- Design an ERD that applies to the data.

- Create and use a SQL database.
- Import and export large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
- Practice using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
- Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.

## Deliverables
In the first half of the challenge we produce the results for a query of the number of retiring employees by title. In the second half of the challenge we determine which employees are eligible for a mentorship program based on parameters (date ranges) we pass in from other tables
